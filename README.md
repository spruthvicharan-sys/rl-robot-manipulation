# RL for Robotic Manipulation

This project explores reinforcement learning methods for robotic manipulation
tasks in simulation, with a focus on control and policy learning.

## Goal
- Train a policy to perform simple manipulation tasks
- Study stability, exploration, and reward design
- Build a clean baseline that can be extended to sim2real

## Planned Approach
- Environment: simulated manipulation task
- Algorithm: policy gradient / actor-critic baseline
- Evaluation: task success and learning curves

## Status
Work in progress — starting with a minimal RL baseline.
